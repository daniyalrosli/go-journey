🌟 My Golang Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Golang journey repository! This space documents my progress, projects, and learnings as I explore the world of Go programming. From beginner experiments to production-ready projects, this journey is all about growth and mastering this powerful, efficient language.


🧐 Why Go?

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google. I chose to learn Go because:
- It’s designed for simplicity and high performance.
- It excels in building scalable, concurrent systems.
- It’s perfect for backend development, cloud applications, and DevOps tools.

 📚 What I’m Learning

Concepts I’m Exploring:

  •	Go Syntax and Basics: Variables, types, and functions.
	•	Concurrency: Go routines, channels, and the power of parallel processing.
	•	Web Development: Building APIs using net/http and frameworks like Gin.
	•	Error Handling: Writing clean, readable code with Go’s explicit error handling.
	•	Database Integration: Using gorm and database/sql to connect with MySQL/PostgreSQL.
	•	Testing: Writing unit tests with the testing package.

 🔨 Projects and Experiments (in progress)
